## Petrol Prices Increase (March 2022)
----

**Information architecture:**

Retail gasoline and diesel prices soared to record highs in March 2022. The visualisation clearly illustrates these changes on a line graph, featuring a reference line representing the prices on the 1st of March. Dots depict the following days. Hovering over dots reveals how the price has risen by percentage since the reference date. Line graphs are commonly used to show the progression of data (in this case the price) over time.

**Design:**

The visualisation is designed to fit on a single page, featuring only essential elements: a brief description explaining how to use the graph and radio buttons at the bottom for plot adjustments. The data used pertains to an exemplary petrol station in Germany (located at 86480 Krumbach) and was obtained from the [TankerkÃ¶nig API](https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de), subsequently extracted into separate csv-gist files.
